# Client and server for interacting with pagoPA (Experimental)

This is experimental code, beware!

This repository contains code generated from pagoPA WSDLs for the interaction
flow between a PSP and the Payment Node.

This repository is part of the [Digital Citizenship project](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/it/projects/cittadinanza-digitale.htm).

In this version was made a customization on autogenerated types to import the package in italia-pagopa-proxy. Importo types was modified from 

```
importoSingoloVersamento: "minInclusive" | "maxInclusive" | "fractionDigits" | "totalDigits";

```
to 

```
importoSingoloVersamento: number;

```
This modification was made for all properties that starts with 'importo'
